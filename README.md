# Dark Math Horizon - Personal Portfolio

Built by Mekan Agahanov

## About This Project
I built this portfolio to showcase my passion for mathematics, algorithms, and software development. It serves as a dynamic platform where I can share my projects, mathematical insights, and algorithmic solutions. The portfolio features a modern, interactive interface with a secure admin dashboard that allows me to easily manage and update content.

## What You Can Do
- **Browse Projects**: Explore my technical projects with detailed descriptions and GitHub links
- **Discover Mathematics**: Dive into mathematical concepts, equations, and their real-world applications
- **Learn Algorithms**: Study various algorithmic solutions and their implementations
- **Download Resume**: Access my latest resume directly from the About page
- **Contact**: Connect with me through LinkedIn or GitHub

## Admin Features
Through the secure admin dashboard, I can:
- Add/edit projects with descriptions and GitHub links
- Upload and manage mathematical topics and equations
- Share algorithm implementations and explanations
- Upload and update my resume
- Manage all content dynamically without code changes
